Installation guide

When using an IDE:
1) Install jdk-11.0.2 (Others might be OK, I'm not sure)
2) Install an IDE (I will be using Intellij but these instructions should work for others)
3) Follow this installation guide to get the SQLite JBDC driver to allow you to connect to the DB http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/sqlite-jdbc-driver/
4) Download SQLite DB browser from the following link http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/
5) Open up your IDE and checkout project from version control. Select github and enter the url https://github.com/georgefox6/FootballLeague.git
6) Add the SQLite JBDC driver to your library (In  FILE -> project structure -> Libraries for IntelliJ users)
7) Navigate to FootballLeague/Football/src in the file explorer in the IDE
8) Right click on Gui.java and click run

This is a temporary installation guide and will be updated after further testing
